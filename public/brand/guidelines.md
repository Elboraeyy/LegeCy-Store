# LegaCy: Phase 1 Core Identity Bible

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **IMMUTABLE LAW:** This document defines the absolute core of the LegaCy brand. These rules are final. Every future product, campaign, or design must strictly adhere to the principles defined here.

---

## 1. Brand Essence

### The Vision

To be the definitive symbol of the quiet, self-assured modern gentleman. A world where luxury is defined not by price, but by the dignity of craftsmanship and the value of time.

### The Mission

To create timeless artifacts—watches, leather goods, and accessories—that do not just tell time or hold money, but anchor a man's identity in a fast-paced world.

### Core Values

1.  **Quiet Confidence**: We are never loud. True power whispers. It does not shout.
2.  **Timelessness**: We reject trends. If it won't look good in 50 years, we don't make it.
3.  **Integrity**: Beauty on the inside (movement, stitching) matters as much as the outside.
4.  **Masculinity**: A celebration of strength, responsibility, and refined elegance.
5.  **Heritage**: We build for the next generation. A "LegaCy" is what you leave behind.

### Tone of Voice

- **We Speak**: With brevity and precision.
- **We Are**: Sophisticated, knowledgeable, and calm.
- **We Are Not**: Hype-driven, slang-heavy, or overly emotional.

## 2. Logo Philosophy

### The Visual Signature

The LegaCy logo is not just text; it is a signature of approval.

- **The Font (Great Vibes)**: Selected to mimic the fluidity of handwriting and the flow of time itself. It contrasts sharply with the rigid, geometric world of digital screens, offering a human, aristocratic touch.
- **The Capital 'C'**: The capitalization of the 'C' creates a "Visual Bridge". It balances the weight of the design, creating a dual structure:
  - **Lega**: The Foundation (The Past).
  - **Cy**: The Continuation (The Future).
- **Emotional Resonance**: The logo feels personal, like a handwritten letter from a grandfather or a signed deed to a property. It evokes trust and history.

## 3. The Logo System

### A. Primary Logo (Vertical Stacked)

- **Definition**: The word "Lega" sitting proudly above "Cy", slightly rotated (-3 degrees) for dynamic energy.
- **Must Use**: Product packaging (box lids), Main Signage, Hero Website Headers, Vertical Posters.
- **Never Use**: Horizontal navigation bars (too tall), Small website footers (too detailed).

### B. Secondary Logo (Horizontal)

- **Definition**: "LegaCy" written on a single line.
- **Must Use**: Website Navigation Bars, Document Footers, Pen Clips, Wide/Short Ad Banners.
- **Never Use**: When you have ample vertical space (the stacked version is preferred for impact).

### C. Icon Logo (The Monogram)

- **Definition**: The letters "LC" intertwined or placed in a seal.
- **Must Use**: Social Media Avatars, App Icons, Favicons, Cufflinks, Zipper Pulls, Wax Seals.
- **Never Use**: As the _only_ branding on a main product (unless the full name is elsewhere).

### D. The 'L' Mark (The Symbol)

- **Definition**: The solitary Great Vibes 'L'.
- **Use Case**: Watch Crowns, tiny rivets, pattern generation.

## 4. Color Application Rules

### The Palette

- **Primary: Deep Green (#12403C)**. The Color of the Infinite.
- **Accent: Warm Gold (#F6E5C6)**. The Color of the Spark.

### Immutable Rules

1.  **The Gold Rule**: Gold text (#F6E5C6) should primarily live on Dark Backgrounds (Green/Black). If placed on white, it risks legibility issues and "cheapness".
2.  **The Green Rule**: The Deep Green is the dominating force. It should consume 60-80% of the visual field in packaging and retail.
3.  **Dark Mode First**: The brand natively belongs in the dark. Light visuals are secondary and should feel like "Paper" (Off-white), never pure digital white (#FFF).
4.  **No Gradients**: In flat design (Web/Print), colors are solid. Gold gradients are reserved ONLY for "Foil Simulation" in mockups.

## 5. Typography System

### Hierarchy & Logic

The tension between the _Old_ (Great Vibes) and the _New_ (Montserrat) defines our look.

1.  **Display (The Creator)**: `Great Vibes`
    - **Use for**: The Logo, Product Names (e.g., "The Chrono"), and Short Emotional Hooks (e.g., "Time Waits").
    - **Rule**: Never use for sentences. Never use for paragraphs.

2.  **Headings (The Architect)**: `Montserrat` (Medium/Regular)
    - **Use for**: Section Headers, Navigation Links, Buttons.
    - **Style**: Often Uppercase with wide letter-spacing (2px - 4px).

3.  **Body (The Narrator)**: `Montserrat` (Light 300)
    - **Use for**: All long-form text, descriptions, details.
    - **Style**: Elegant, thin, highly readable.
    - **Arabic**: If Arabic is introduced, use `Tajawal` or `Cairo` (Light weights) to match Montserrat's geometry.

## 6. Logo Usage Rules

### Clear Space (The Zone of Respect)

The logo must breathe. Imagine a box around the logo.

- **Rule**: The minimum clear space on all sides is equal to the height of the letter "L".
- **Violation**: Placing text or other elements inside this invisible box is forbidden.

### Minimum Sizes

- **Digital**: 24px height (Horizontal), 32px height (Stacked). Favicon: 16px.
- **Print**: 8mm width. Anything smaller requires the Icon version.

### Forbidden Sins (Do Not Do)

- **Do Not**: Add shadows to the logo (unless physical 3D signs).
- **Do Not**: Outline the logo.
- **Do Not**: Change the rotation angle (fix at -3deg).
- **Do Not**: Use the logo in any color other than Gold, White, Black, or Dark Green.

## 7. Premium Finish Guidelines

### A. Gold Foil (Packaging/Print)

- **Technique**: Hot Foil Stamping.
- **Color Match**: Pantone 871 C (Metallic).
- **Surface**: Best on Matte Deep Green paper or Soft-touch laminate.

### B. Blind Emboss (Leather)

- **Technique**: Heat Stamping without foil.
- **Result**: A darken, sunken impression.
- **Vibe**: The ultimate understatement. "If you know, you know."

### C. Laser Engraving (Metal)

- **Technique**: Fiber Laser Annealing.
- **Result**: Dark Grey / Black mark on Steel/Silver.
- **Vibe**: Precision engineering.

### D. Digital Screen

- **Technique**: Solid Hex #F6E5C6.
- **Constraint**: No faux-metallic gradients on the website logo. Keep it flat and clean.
