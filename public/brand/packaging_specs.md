# LegaCy Phase 2: Packaging & Unboxing Architecture

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **MANUFACTURING DIRECTIVE**: This document outlines the technical and aesthetic specifications for all LegaCy packaging. Deviations in material weight, color accuracy (Pantone 871C / #12403C), or finishing quality are unacceptable.

## 1. Packaging Strategy Overview

### The Philosophy: "The Vault"
LegaCy packaging is not a wrapper; it is a sanctuary for the product. It plays on the concept of "The Vault"—secure, heavy, private, and valuable.
*   **Weight**: Every box must feel heavier than expected. Weight = Value.
*   **Silence**: Openings must be smooth (friction-fit) and silent. No clicking cheap plastic.
*   **The Reveal**: Slow and deliberate. We sell patience.

### The Hierarchy
1.  **Primary Vessel**: The rigid box housing the product (High Cost/High Touch).
2.  **Secondary Shield**: Dust bags, tissue paper, sleeves (Protection/Anticipation).
3.  **Transport Layer**: Shipping boxes, shopping bags (Utility/Branding).

## 6. The Unboxing Sequence (Psychology)

1.  **Transport**: Customer sees a discreet box. Security is implied.
2.  **Breach**: Cutting the tape. The physical act of entry.
3.  **Anticipation**: Lifting the flaps reveals a cloud of tissue paper and a Thank You card.
4.  **Discovery**: Breaking the Gold Seal sticker. The rustle of tissue.
5.  **The Encounter**: The Primary Box (Watch/Wallet). It feels heavy, cool, and smooth.
6.  **The Climax**: The "Suction" opening of the lid. The product sits beautifully centered, smelling of leather/factory freshness.

## 7. Do's & Don'ts

### DO
*   **Do** test the "Shake Test". Nothing should rattle inside the box.
*   **Do** match the Gold Foil exactly to the metal hardware of the products.
*   **Do** use magnetic closures where appropriate (hidden magnets only).

### DON'T
*   **Don't** use glossy lamination. It shows fingerprints and looks cheap. Always Matte or Soft-touch.
*   **Don't** print the logo on the bottom of the box. Use the bottom for legal text/barcodes only.
*   **Don't** allow "white edges" on rigid boxes. Wrap the paper fully around the edges.
