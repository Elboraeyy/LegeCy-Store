# LegaCy Phase 3: Social Media Strategy & Identity

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **STRATEGIC MANDATE**: Social Media is LegaCy's primary storefront. It must feel like an exclusive club, not a billboard. Every post must earn its place in the feed through beauty, wisdom, or value. **Quality over Quantity.**

---

## 1. Brand Strategy: The "Quiet Luxury" Doctrine

### The Role of Social
*   **Instagram**: The Brand Portfolio. High polish, curated, permanent.
*   **Facebook**: The Community Hub & Ad Engine. Discussion, conversion focused.

### Visual Philosophy: "Visual Silence"
In a feed full of noise, neon colors, and screaming faces, LegaCy wins by being quiet.
*   **The Pause**: Our posts should feel like a deep breath. Dark, calm, minimal.
*   **Masculinity**: Communicated through shadows, structure, and weight. No frantic movement.

---

## 2. Feed Visual System

### The Grid Logic: Rows of Three
We do not use a "Checkerboard" pattern (too common). We tell stories in Rows.
*   **Row Logic**: 1 Quote (Philosophy) + 1 Product Macro (Detail) + 1 Lifestyle (Mood).
*   **The framing**:
    *   **Full Bleed**: For Lifestyle and Mood images (Immersive).
    *   **Framed (Borders)**: For Products and Quotes (Gallery feel).
    *   **Backgrounds**: 70% Deep Green (#12403C), 20% Black, 10% Cream/Gold.

### Typography Rules
*   **Great Vibes**: ONLY for the Brand Name or Single Impact Words (e.g., "Legacy", "Time", "Details"). **NEVER** for captions or body text.
*   **Montserrat**: All captions, quotes, and descriptions.
    *   *Quotes*: Montserrat Light (Italic).
    *   *Headlines*: Montserrat Regular (Uppercase, Wide Spacing).

## 3. Content Pillars (The 6-C System)

1.  **CRAFT (Product Excellence)**
    *   *Visual*: Macro shots of stitching, watch movements, leather grain.
    *   *Purpose*: Builds Authority. Show *why* it costs what it costs.
2.  **CODE (Masculine Philosophy)**
    *   *Visual*: Minimal text on dark backgrounds. Short, stoic quotes.
    *   *Purpose*: Builds Value/Alignment. "We think like you."
3.  **CLASS (Lifestyle Aspiration)**
    *   *Visual*: Old money aesthetic. Classic cars, suits, architecture. No faces.
    *   *Purpose*: Builds Desire. "The life you want."
4.  **CONTROL (Grooming & Self-Care)**
    *   *Visual*: Bathroom countertop setups. Rituals. Foam, water, razors.
    *   *Purpose*: Builds Routine/Trust.
5.  **CLUB (Social Proof)**
    *   *Visual*: User photos (re-graded to match our filter). VIP unboxings.
    *   *Purpose*: Builds Community.
6.  **COMMERCE (The Offer)**
    *   *Visual*: Clean product shots with clear value propositions.
    *   *Purpose*: Conversion. (Done tastefully).

## 5. Stories & Reels System

### Reels Guidelines

*   **Style**: Cinematic B-roll. No talking heads. No dancing.

## 6. Ads Creative Direction

### The "No-Ad" Ad
*   **Concept**: Ads that look like lifestyle posts.
*   **Visual**: High-contrast product shot on a dark table.
*   **Copy**: "The last wallet you will ever buy."

### The "Authority" Ad
*   **Concept**: Social proof led.
*   **Visual**: Split screen. Top: Product. Bottom: 5-Star Review text.
*   **Copy**: "Join 10,000 men who upgraded their carry."

### The "Unboxing" Ad

*   **Visual**: Hands opening the packaging (Sound On).
*   **Copy**: "Experience the vault."

---

## 7. Do's & Don'ts

### DO
*   **Do**: Use negative space. Empty space creates a feeling of luxury.
*   **Do**: Reply to comments with dignity ("Thank you, Sir" vs "Thanks bro!").
*   **Do**: Post at consistent times to build a ritual.

### DON'T
*   **Don't**: Use hashtags in the caption. Hide them in the first comment.
*   **Don't**: Post low-resolution memes.
*   **Don't**: Use "Salesy" stickers (e.g., "50% OFF" bright red bubbles).
